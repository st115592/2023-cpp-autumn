Daniel Bernoulli became famous mainly as the founder of mathematical physics. He significantly supplemented the theory of gases, hydrodynamics and aerodynamics.It is also he who owns the idea that gas pressure is possible due to the thermal motion of molecules. He became the author of the equation of stationary incompressible fluid flow, that called "Bernoulli's law". This rule underlies the dynamics of liquids and gases. In mathematics, he has published a number of studies on probability theory, series theory, numerical methods and differential equations.
